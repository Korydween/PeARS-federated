       <p id="firsttime"><b>What is this?</b></p>
       <p>Welcome, stranger! You are on an instance of 'PeARS Federated', a decentralised search engine. Every instance of PeARS can be considered a mini search engine for a single topic of interest. The focus of <a href="YOUR SITE URL">YOUR SITE</a> is Big Tech and AI. Other instances deal with different topics.</p>
       <p>The idea behind PeARS is that each instance is populated via crowdsourcing. That means that if you sign up for an account, you can contribute to the content of the search index by sharing interesting URLs. This ensures that the index is of particularly high quality, as it has been vetted by human contributors.</p>

       <br><br>
       <p id="indexurl"><b>How do I help?</b></p>
       <p>First, <a href="{{url_for('auth.signup')}}">sign up</a> for an account on this instance. We are happy to have you onboard!</a>
       <p>Every PeARS instance includes an <a href="{{url_for('indexer.index')}}">indexing page</a> which helps you with the hard work of converting documents into searchable representations. You can index in several ways but we will start with the simplest one, which consists in typing a single URL in the 'Index a single URL' box -- this will index just that page. You should also enter a keyword under the URL, telling PeARS the topic of the page you want to index. Over time, this will contribute to the creation of <a href="#newpods">pods</a>, which you can manage individually. Finally, add an optional trigger warning (if the page contains elements that you feel might be upsetting for others), and tell us whether you would like your username to appear next to your contribution in the search results. (By default, that box is ticked, so untick it if you prefer to stay anonymous.)</p>

       <br><br>
       <p id="newpods"><b>What is a pod?</b></p>
       <p>A pod is an index dedicated to a particular subtopic on the PeARS instance. Imagine the URL collection on this site is a library, and you are the librarian labelling different sections of your bookshelves. Having labelled sections help you direct visitors to the right book more easily. It also helps you and your fellow contributors managing the collection you have built.</p>
       <p>If needed, you can go and check which pages have been indexed for a particular subtopic. Head over to <a href="{{url_for('orchard.index')}}">Pods</a>. There, you will find a pod for each keyword that has ever been used in the indexer. Each pod in the making shows you its current size. You can check the content of the pod by clicking on it. It is also possible to download the information contained in that pod.</p>

       <p id="contribute"><b>How do I contribute to the PeARS code?</b></p>
       <p>We'd love to see you on our GitHub repos! Come and join the discussion <a href="https://github.com/orgs/PeARSearch/discussions">here</a>.</p>

       <p id="indexurl"><b>What is your approach to copyright?</b></p>
       <p>Copyright is a big topic at the moment, as Big Tech companies are often accused of indiscriminately crawling Web content to train AI models, and by extension, AI-based search.</p>
       <p>PeARS always respects copyright holders. It automatically checks constraints set by robots.txt files and it only displays minimal snippets in search results. If you wish for your site to be removed from the the index, simply contact the admin for this instance, and we will delete your content.</p>
